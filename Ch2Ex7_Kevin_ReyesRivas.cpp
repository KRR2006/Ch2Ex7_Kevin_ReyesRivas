Title: Chapter 2 Exercise 7 from Text - Ocean levels
File: Ch2Ex7_Kevin_ReyesRivas.cpp
Programmer: Kevin Reyes Rivas
Date: 08/2024
Requirements:
Assuming the ocean�s level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write a program that displays:
� The number of millimeters higher than the current level 
        that the ocean�s level will be in 5 years.
� The number of millimeters higher than the current level 
        that the ocean�s level will be in 7 years.
� The number of millimeters higher than the current level 
        that the ocean�s level will be in 10 years.
